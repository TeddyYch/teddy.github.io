Welcome to my page. As a Computer Science student at HKUST, I'm constantly driven by a curiosity for how things work and a desire to build. My path to software engineering is a bit unconventionalâ€”I started with a degree in accounting before making a full transition to tech. This background has proven to be a major asset, helping me understand the bigger picture of how technology impacts business and processes. I've had the privilege of gaining practical experience through internships at places like Kinetix Systems and YMCA HK. When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new frameworks or working towards my next certification, like the MS-AI900 and Alibaba Cloud Computing.
